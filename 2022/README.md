# Advent of Code 2022

In swifttttttt :)

Day 1: ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
- Reading from files in Swift was so hard to figure out for some reason?? Stack overflow was not in my favour
- Probably not one of my more efficient solutions either, but oh well

Day 2: ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
- You cannot subscript strings with an int in swift????? HUH?????? WHAT DO YOU MEAN I GOTTA DEFINE A STRING.INDEX??????
- Dicts/Maps are your best friend here.

Day 3: ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
- My solution for this is SOOOOOOOO INEFFICIENT, A LOT OF REPEATED CODE
- At least I figured out that you can do string.prefix() to get the first few characters of a string :)
- I'm gunna need to refactor this code cause arghhhhhhh
- I'm understanding Swift more though so that's good :)

Day 4: ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
- Set theory came in clutch for this one, definitely going to use it for similar range problems
- Made use of `isSubset()` to check if a range is in another range
- Used `intersection()` to check if a range overlaps another range by at least 1 element (if the intersection of 2 sets is not empty, they share at least 1 element)
