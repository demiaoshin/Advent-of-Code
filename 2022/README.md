# Advent of Code 2022

In swifttttttt :)

Day 1: ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
- Reading from files in Swift was so hard to figure out for some reason?? Stack overflow was not in my favour
- Probably not one of my more efficient solutions either, but oh well

Day 2: ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
- You cannot subscript strings with an int in swift????? HUH?????? WHAT DO YOU MEAN I GOTTA DEFINE A STRING.INDEX??????
- Dicts/Maps are your best friend here.

Day 3: ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
- My solution for this is SOOOOOOOO INEFFICIENT, A LOT OF REPEATED CODE
- At least I figured out that you can do string.prefix() to get the first few characters of a string :)
- I'm gunna need to refactor this code cause arghhhhhhh
- I'm understanding Swift more though so that's good :)
