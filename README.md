# Advent of Code 

Welcome to my advent of code repo!!! 

2021 -> I did this in Python at the time, but I didn't put it on a repo. It's probably hidden somewhere on this laptop and I can't be asked to find it. So every now and then I'll redo a day in Swift😂 \
2022 -> I'm doing it in Swift this year

util is a package that will hold useful swift functions for advent of code challenges.

My findings:
- You can create swift packages by running `swift package init --type executable`. Can't believe I'm only finding out about this now but it's gunna come in handy for future days.
